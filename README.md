# 🌐 AI-Cyber-Awareness-365  
### 365-Day Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign Powered by AI

This repository contains a full year (365 days) of AI-generated cybersecurity awareness content, including:

- 🎨 Cartoon-style visuals generated via AI  
- 📝 Social media captions (Facebook, LinkedIn, X)  
- 🧠 Prompt engineering workflow  
- ⚙️ Automation setup for scheduling posts  
- 📁 Source files (images, prompts, and datasets)

This project demonstrates how AI can accelerate content production and cybersecurity education — compressing **one year of content creation into just a few days**.

## 📘 Project Overview

Cybersecurity awareness is a long-term effort, but creating daily educational content is time-consuming.  
This project uses AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Meta AI) to:

1. Generate 365 unique cybersecurity prompts  
2. Convert each prompt into a cartoon-style visual  
3. Write multi-platform captions automatically  
4. Prepare assets for social media automation  
5. Organize the final output into a structured, reusable format

The goal is to make cybersecurity education accessible, engaging, and scalable.

## 🚀 How the Content Was Generated

### **1️⃣ Prompt Generation**
ChatGPT was instructed to create **365 unique cybersecurity scenarios**, targeting:

- Individuals  
- Employees  
- Business owners  
- Students  
- Social media users  

### **2️⃣ Image Creation**
Each prompt was used to generate cartoon-style visuals using AI tools such as:

- ChatGPT Image Generation  
- Google Gemini  
- Meta AI  

The results were cross-checked between models for consistency.

### **3️⃣ Caption Writing**
For every image, ChatGPT created:

- A Facebook caption  
- An X (Twitter) caption  
- A LinkedIn version  

Each caption includes awareness tips written in simple and engaging language.

### **4️⃣ Automation**
Using a scheduling platform, 365 posts can be deployed automatically across multiple platforms.
