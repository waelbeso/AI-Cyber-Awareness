# 🌐 AI-Cyber-Awareness-365  
### 365-Day Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign Powered by AI

This repository contains a full year (365 days) of AI-generated cybersecurity awareness content, including:

- 🎨 Cartoon-style visuals generated via AI  
- 📝 Social media captions (Facebook, LinkedIn, X)  
- 🧠 Prompt engineering workflow  
- ⚙️ Automation setup for scheduling posts  
- 📁 Source files (images, prompts, and datasets)

This project demonstrates how AI can accelerate content production and cybersecurity education — compressing **one year of content creation into just a few days**.

## 📘 Project Overview

Cybersecurity awareness is a long-term effort, but creating daily educational content is time-consuming.  
This project uses AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Meta AI) to:

1. Generate 365 unique cybersecurity prompts  
2. Convert each prompt into a cartoon-style visual  
3. Write multi-platform captions automatically  
4. Prepare assets for social media automation  
5. Organize the final output into a structured, reusable format

The goal is to make cybersecurity education accessible, engaging, and scalable.
